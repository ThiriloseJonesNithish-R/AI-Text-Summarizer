# AI-Based Notes Reader  
A smart **text summarization and text-to-speech (TTS) tool** built with **Streamlit, Transformers, PyTorch, spaCy, and gTTS**.  

🚀 **Live Demo:** [Click here to try the app](https://ai-text-summarizer-gpkvame6q4ybu72mhb95wx.streamlit.app/)  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Upload a `.txt` file and get an **AI-powered summary**  
✅ Uses **BERT-based NLP models** for accurate text summarization  
✅ **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** converts summaries into audio  
✅ **Simple & clean UI** with **dark mode** (built with Streamlit)  
✅ Fully **open-source and easy to set up**  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
